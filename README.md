# Simple shell

"Our team project, 'Simple Shell,' represents the culmination of a significant effort and serves as a Milestone Project for the C code curriculum at ALX Africa Software Engineering. Known as the 'Gates of Shell,' this project was undertaken during the first trimester and is designed to provide students with a deep understanding of the intricate concepts underpinning shell programming. These concepts encompass a wide array of topics, including process management, system calls, bitwise manipulation, file management, and robust error handling.

'Simple Shell,' at its core, is a minimalistic UNIX command interpreter that faithfully emulates the functionality of the simple shell (sh). The implementation of this program is entirely based on the C programming language, reflecting a comprehensive demonstration of our team's knowledge and skills in the field."

## A C-based simple shell can include the following features:



1. **Display a Prompt and Wait for User Input:**
   - The shell should display a prompt (e.g., `>`) and wait for the user to input a command, which ends with a newline.

2. **Executable Not Found Error Handling:**
   - If an executable is not found in the system's PATH, the shell should print an error message and continue displaying the prompt.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Comprehensive error handling for various scenarios to provide informative error messages.

4. **Handling "End of File" (Ctrl+D):**
   - Proper handling of the "end of file" condition, such as exiting the shell or displaying a message.

5. **Command Line with Arguments:**
   - Ability to handle commands with arguments and pass them to executed programs.

6. **Handling the PATH:**
   - Properly searching the system's PATH for executable files.

7. **Support for 'exit' Feature and Exit Status:**
   - Supporting the `exit` command to exit the shell, along with the ability to set and return exit status.

8. **Ctrl-C Handling:**
   - Handling Ctrl-C (SIGINT) to prevent the shell from terminating and potentially providing a custom behavior.

9. **Command Separator (;):**
   - Ability to execute multiple commands separated by semicolons.

10. **Logical Operators (&& and ||):**
    - Handling logical operators like `&&` and `||` to control the execution of commands based on the success or failure of previous commands.

11. **Variable Replacements ($? and $$):**
    - Replacing variables like `$?` (exit status of the last command) and `$$` (the shell's PID).

12. **Comments (#):**
    - Ignoring and handling comments when encountered in the input.

13. **History Feature:**
    - Maintaining command history and allowing users to navigate through previous commands.

14. **File Input:**
    - Reading and executing commands from script files or redirecting input from files using `<`.

These features will collectively make for a functional and versatile simple shell in C. Keep in mind that implementing all of these features requires careful design and code organization.
